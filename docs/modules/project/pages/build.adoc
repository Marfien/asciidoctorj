= Build the Project

Invoke Gradle on this project using the `gradlew` command (i.e., the Gradle Wrapper).

TIP: We strongly recommend that you use Gradle via the https://www.timroes.de/2013/09/12/speed-up-gradle[Gradle daemon].

To clone the project, compile the source and build the artifacts (i.e., jars) locally, run:

 $ git clone https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj
   cd asciidoctorj
   ./gradlew assemble

You can find the built artifacts in the [path]_asciidoctorj-*/build/libs_ folders.

To execute tests when running the build, use:

 $ ./gradlew build

To only execute the tests, run:

 $ ./gradlew check

You can also run tests for a single module:

 $ cd asciidoctorj-core
   ../gradlew check

To run a single test in the asciidoctorj-core subproject, use:

 $ ../gradlew -Dsingle.test=NameOfTestClass test

To create the distribution, run:

 $ ./gradlew distZip

You can find the distribution in the [path]_asciidoctorj-distribution/build/distributions_ folder.
